# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts in Java

## Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide and example implementation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java. The goal is to provide a clear understanding of fundamental OOP principles and demonstrate their application in real-world Java programs.

## Object-Oriented Programming

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of "objects," which can contain data and code to manipulate that data. The four main principles of OOP are encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

## Java Program Structure

Java is a widely used, class-based, object-oriented programming language. It follows the principles of Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA), making it platform-independent. A Java program typically consists of classes, methods, variables, and other elements that collectively define the program's structure.

## Classes and Objects

In Java, a class is a blueprint for objects. Objects are instances of classes and can contain both data (attributes) and methods (functions). This section provides examples and explanations of how to create classes and use objects in Java.

## Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism in OOP that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. Java supports single and multiple inheritance through classes and interfaces. Examples in this repository illustrate how to use inheritance effectively in Java.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type. This section explores method overloading, method overriding, and the use of interfaces to achieve polymorphic behavior in Java.

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation involves bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit known as a class. This section demonstrates how to use access modifiers to control access to class members and achieve encapsulation.

## Abstraction

Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on their essential characteristics. This section provides examples of abstract classes and interfaces, showcasing how abstraction is implemented in Java.
